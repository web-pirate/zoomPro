This project integrates Zoom API with a Ruby on Rails application to manage Zoom meetings and users. It includes functionality to create meetings, list meetings, add users, and handle Zoom webhook events.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ruby
- Rails
- Zoom API credentials (API Key and API Secret)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/zoom-integration.git
    cd zoom-integration
    ```

2. Install the required gems:
    ```sh
    bundle install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables for Zoom API credentials:
    ```sh
    export ZOOM_API_KEY=your_zoom_api_key
    export ZOOM_API_SECRET=your_zoom_api_secret
    ```

4. Run database migrations:
    ```sh
    rails db:migrate
    ```

## Usage

### Creating a Meeting

To create a meeting, send a POST request to `/zoom/create_meeting` with the following parameters:
- `topic`: The topic of the meeting
- `start_time`: The start time of the meeting

Example:
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/zoom/create_meeting -d "topic=My Meeting" -d "start_time=2023-10-01T10:00:00Z"


# Listing Meetings
To list all meetings for the current user, send a GET request to /zoom/list_meetings.

Example:

Adding a User
To add a new user to Zoom, send a POST request to /zoom/add_user with the following parameters:

email: The email of the user
first_name: The first name of the user
last_name: The last name of the user
Example:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/zoom/add_user -d "email=user@example.com" -d "first_name=John" -d "last_name=Doe"


Handling Webhook Events
To handle Zoom webhook events, set up a POST request to /zoom/webhook. This will handle events such as recording.completed and update the meeting with the recording URL.

Models
User
The User model includes the following fields:

email: The email of the user
zoom_user_id: The Zoom user ID
